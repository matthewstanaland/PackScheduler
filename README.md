PackScheduler

A Course Scheduling System for Efficient Academic Planning

Overview

PackScheduler is a course scheduling system designed to help students efficiently manage their academic schedules. Developed as part of coursework at NC State University, this system ensures conflict-free scheduling, credit validation, and persistent storage for course records.

It enforces strict course scheduling rules, allowing students to only register for courses that fit within their credit limits and available time slots.

Features

âœ… Course Registration & Management â€“ Add, remove, and modify course selections
âœ… Schedule Conflict Detection â€“ Prevents time slot overlaps
âœ… Student & Faculty Management â€“ Organize and track user schedules
âœ… Data Persistence â€“ Save and load schedules via CSV file storage
âœ… Validation Rules â€“ Ensure valid meeting times, course credit limits, and unique course sections
âœ… JUnit Testing â€“ Fully unit-tested for reliability
